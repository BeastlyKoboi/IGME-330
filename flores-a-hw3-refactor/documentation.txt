The language I transferred this project to was typescript. 
I made the suggested changes to get rid of errors and then tackled the warnings. 
I added two interfaces colorStop and drawParams in order to better utilize typescript 
when drawing. I refrained from changing the DEFAULTS in main and audio to an enum, 
because I still needed to change that information after loading in the startin state 
from the JSON. There was definitely a better way to do it, but I was unable to find a 
solution that was much better.
